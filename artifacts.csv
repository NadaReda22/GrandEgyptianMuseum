"Statue of Ka-aper","D:/GrandegyptianMuseum/artifacts/Ka-aper.jpg","Due to the lack of quality timber, such as cedar wood, in ancient egypt, the egyptians had to import it from Lebanon. Also, the nature of wood, which does not withstand the passage of time like stone, made wooden statues rare. This beautiful piece depicts the 'reader scribe' Ka-aper, who was given the nickname 'Sheikh el-Balad' by Mariette's excavation workers, as he resembled the village mayor, a title still used today, even by non-Egyptians. Ka-aper is shown as a stout man, possibly reflecting the appearance of the wealthy. His eyes are inlaid with calcite, crystal, and black stone, outlined with copper, mimicking eye makeup. All these details, along with the facial features, bring life to the statue. Ka-aper is holding what seems to be a cylindrical object in his right hand and a staff in his left hand (the current version is a replica). The statue is in a walking pose, with his left foot stepping forward. Provenance: Saqqara, Mastaba of Ka-aper Date: Old Kingdom, 5th Dynasty (2465–2323 BCE) Material: Wood, eyes made of crystal, calcite, copper, and black stone","egypt"
